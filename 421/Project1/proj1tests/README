Type make inside this directory(proj1tests) to compile all tests files.
Some personal tests were done just by editing these files.

proj1_init.c: Basic implementation of init system call

proj1_shutdown.c: Basic implementation of shutdown system call

proj1_create.c: Basic implementation of create system call

proj1_destroy.c: Basic implementation of destroy system call

proj1_count.c: Basic implementation of count system call

proj1_send.c: Basic implementation of send system call

proj1_recv.c: Basic implementation of recv system call

proj1_length.c: Basic implementation of length system call

proj1_acl_add.c: Basic implementation of acl_add system call

proj1_acl_remove.c: Basic implementation of acl_remove system call

proj1_nolist.c: Attempts to run every system call without initializing the list

proj1_notroot.c: Run as not root to test root authentication. All system calls should fail as init cannot run without being root, therefore no list exists(like previous test)

proj1_notexist.c: Run as root. Creates mailbox with ID 1, destroys it then has other system calls try to access it.
